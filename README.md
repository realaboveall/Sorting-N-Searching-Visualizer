# Sorting algorithm visualizer

This web application is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to visualize classic sorting algorithms. (Yes, we have decided what the classics areðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.)

## Purpose

Our Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. By representing data as colorful geometric shapes, this visualizer demonstrates how different algorithms organize data, allowing users to see the processes in action.

## This application supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**.
2. **Insertion Sort**.
3. **Selection Sort**.
4. **Merge Sort**.
5. **Quick Sort**.

## And the following searching Algorithms:

1. **Linear Search**.
2. **Binary Search**.

We will add more in the future, maybe
